# Social Network Backend

## Description
This project was created to simulate the backend of a social networking website where users can add friends, create thoughts (posts), and add reactions to those thoughts. The backend was built using MongoDB, a NoSQL database program, and utilizes Express.js to run a web server.

## Installation
To install, clone the repository to machine then use `npm install` to install the necessary packages to run the application (Express, Mongoose). Mongoose is a schema-based solution to help with modeling the data in MongoDB. Node also must be installed on machine.

## Usage
To see backend in action, use `npm start` to start the web server and use an API tool, such as Insomnia, to test each of the routes. For more instruction, view the video walkthrough below.
